# mediaLazyLoader.js (Simple lazy loader with support for tags <img>, <picture>, <video>, <iframe> and background images.)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malchata/yall.js.svg?branch=shadowfax)](https://travis-ci.org/malchata/yall.js) ![](http://img.badgesize.io/malchata/yall.js/master/dist/yall-2.0.0.min.js?label=Uncompressed) ![](http://img.badgesize.io/malchata/yall.js/master/dist/yall-2.0.0.min.js?compression=gzip&label=gzip)

yall.js is a featured-packed lazy loading script for `<img>`, `<picture>`, `<video>` and `<iframe>` elements. It works in all modern browsers including IE11. It uses [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) where available, but falls back to `scroll`, `touchmove`, `resize`, and `orientationchange` events where necessary. It can also monitor the DOM for changes using [Mutation Observer](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/05/dom-mutationobserver-reacting-to-dom-changes-without-killing-browser-performance/) to lazy load image elements that have been appended to the DOM after initial page render, which may be desirable for single page applications. It can also (optionally) optimize use of browser idle time using [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback). To optimize decoding of `<img>` lazy loading for simple `src` and `srcset` use cases, yall.js uses [`Image.decode`](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5637156160667648) where available to decode images asynchronously before adding them to the DOM.

## Usage

This is version 2 of yall.js, and introduces some breaking changes over version 1. While the first version only required you to include the script and tag elements with a `class` of `lazy`, this script needs to be explicitly initialized like so:

```html
<script src="yall.min.js"></script>
<script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", yall);</script>
```

The above syntax is sufficient if you don't want to pass in any options. [If you want to specify options](#api-options), however, you'll need to use a slightly more verbose syntax:

```html
<script src="yall.min.js"></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    yall({
      observeChanges: true
    });
  });
</script>
```

From there, lazy loading elements with yall.js is simple! Let's look at the simplest `<img>` element use case:

```html
<!-- A simple src-only <img> element example -->
<img class="lazy" src="placeholder.jpg" data-src="image-to-lazy-load.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
```

In this case, we specify an optional placeholder image in the `src` attribute, and point to the image we want to lazy load in the `data-src` attribute. Attaching a `class` of `lazy` exposes elements to yall.js, and is necessary for the lazy loader to work (although this class value can be overridden via the API options). Let's look at an example using both `src` and `srcset`:

```html
<!-- A somewhat more complex src + srcset example -->
<img class="lazy" src="placeholder.jpg" data-srcset="image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" data-src="image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
```

Since `<picture>` is a thing now, yall.js supports that, too:

```html
<!-- A more complex <picture> + <img> + src/srcset example -->
<picture>
  <source data-srcset="image-to-lazy-load-2x.webp 2x, image-to-lazy-load-1x.webp 1x" type="image/webp">
  <img class="lazy" src="placeholder.jpg" data-srcset="image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" data-src="image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
</picture>
```

You can also use yall.js to lazy load `<video>` elements! This is useful if you are replacing animated GIF with autoplaying video:

```html
<video class="lazy" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source data-src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source data-src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

The pattern is largely the same as it is with the `<picture>` use case, only the `lazy` class is applied to the `<video>` element. **Tip**: If you're embedding videos that don't emulate animated GIF behavior (i.e., non autoplaying video), it's better to _not_ lazy load them. Instead, lean on the [`preload` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-preload) to defer loading of video content.

As of version 2, you can also lazy load `<iframe>`s! This looks pretty much just like a simple `<img>` example:

```html
<iframe class="lazy" data-src="some-other-document.html"></iframe>
```

## What about users without JavaScript?

Easy! Slap on some `<noscript>` goodness:

```html
<!-- A <noscript> example using <img> with src and srcset. -->
<img class="lazy" data-srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" data-src="/img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" src="/img/placeholder.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
<noscript>
  <img class="lazy" srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" src="/img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
</noscript>

<!-- And a <picture> example. -->
<picture>
  <source data-srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.webp 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.webp 1x" type="image/webp">
  <img class="lazy" data-srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" data-src="/img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" src="/img/placeholder.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
</picture>
<noscript>
  <picture>
    <source srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.webp 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.webp 1x" type="image/webp">
    <img class="lazy" srcset="/img/image-to-lazy-load-2x.jpg 2x, /img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg 1x" src="/img/image-to-lazy-load-1x.jpg" alt="Alternative text to describe image.">
  </picture>
</noscript>

<!-- Here's a <video> example, too. -->
<video class="lazy" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source data-src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source data-src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<noscript>
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</noscript>

<!-- Here's an <iframe> example for good measure. -->
<iframe class="lazy" data-src="lazy.html"></iframe>
<noscript>
  <iframe src="lazy.html"></iframe>
</noscript>
```

Then place a `no-js` class on the `<html>` element like so:

```html
<html class="no-js">
```

Finally, add this one line `<script>` before any `<link>` or `<style>` elements in the document `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Remove the no-js class on the <html> element if JavaScript is on -->
<script>document.documentElement.classList.remove("no-js")</script>
```

Normally, this script will remove the `no-js` class from the `<html>` element as the page loads, but if JavaScript is turned off, this will never happen. From there, you can add some CSS that hides elements with a `class` of `lazy` when the `no-js` class is present on the `<html>` element:

```css
/* Hide .lazy elements if JavaScript is off */
.no-js .lazy {
  display: none;
}
```

To see all use cases in action, check out the demos in the `test` folder.

## API options

When you call the main `yall` initializing function, you can pass an in an options object. Here are the current options available:

- `lazyClass` (default is `"lazy"`): The element class used by yall.js to find elements to lazy load. Change this is if a `class` attribute value of `lazy` conflicts with your application.
- `throttleTime` (default is `200`): In cases where Intersection Observer isn't available, standard event handlers are used. `throttleTime` allows you to control how often the code within these event handlers fire in milliseconds.
- `idlyLoad` (default is `false`): If set to `true`, `requestIdleCallback` is used to optimize use of browser idle time to limit monopolization of the main thread. _**Notes:** This setting is ignored if set to `true` in a browser that doesn't support `requestIdleCallback`! Additionally, enabling this could cause lazy loading to be delayed significantly more than you might be okay with! This option trades off some degree of seamless lazy loading in favor of optimized use of browser idle time. Test extensively, and consider increasing the `threshold` option if you set this option to `true`!_
- `idleLoadTimeout` (default is `100`): If `idlyLoad` is set to `true`, this option sets a deadline in milliseconds for `requestIdleCallback` to kick off lazy loading for an element.
- `threshold` (default is `200`): The threshold (in pixels) for how far elements need to be within the viewport to begin lazy loading. This value affects lazy loading initiated by both Intersection Observer and legacy event handlers.
- `observeChanges` (default is `false`): Use a Mutation Observer to examine the DOM for changes. This is useful if you're using yall.js in a single page application and want to lazy load resources for markup injected into the page after initial page render. _**Note:** This option is ignored if set to `true` in a browser that doesn't support Mutation Observer!_
- `observeRootSelector` (default is `"body"`): If `observeChanges` is set to `true`, the value of this string is fed into `document.querySelector` to limit the scope in which the Mutation Observer looks for DOM changes. `document.body` is inferred by default, but you can confine it to any valid CSS selector (e.g., `div#main-wrapper`).
- `mutationObserverOptions` (default is `{childList: true}`): Options to pass to the `MutationObserver` instance. Read [this MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#MutationObserverInit) for a list of options.

## Limitations

yall.js doesn't care about placeholders. It won't try to minimize layout shifting or perform layout calculations for you. It's recommended to use a placeholder method such as [LQIP](https://www.guypo.com/introducing-lqip-low-quality-image-placeholders/) or [SQIP](https://github.com/technopagan/sqip) to fill the image space prior to lazy loading in conjunction with appropriate `width` and `height` attributes on elements. For `<video>` elements, use the `poster` attribute set a placeholder image. Please check out the `test` folder to see how you might use placeholders in conjunction with yall.js. If you don't want to bother with placeholders, you can omit the `src` attribute entirely in your lazy loading markup, and yall.js will still work.
